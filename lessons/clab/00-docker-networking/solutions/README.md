# Lesson 0 Solutions

Reference solutions for the Container Networking exercises.

## Exercise 1: Inspect Docker's Network Plumbing

**What is the IP of docker0? How does it relate to the default gateway?**

The `docker0` bridge is typically `172.17.0.1`. Inside each container, `ip route` shows this as the default gateway:

```
default via 172.17.0.1 dev eth0
172.17.0.0/16 dev eth0 scope link src 172.17.0.2
```

The bridge IS the gateway -- packets from containers destined outside the subnet go to `docker0`, and the host routes them.

**How to match a host-side veth to its container-side eth0:**

The `@ifN` index on each end references the other end. For example:
- On the host: `vethXXXXXXX@if5` -- the `if5` means interface index 5 is the other end
- In the container: `5: eth0@if6` -- the `if6` means interface index 6 is the host end

You can verify with:
```bash
# On the host
ip link show master docker0
```

```
6: veth1234567@if5: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    master docker0 state UP
```

```bash
# In the container
docker exec c1 ip addr
```

```
5: eth0@if6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> ...
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 scope global eth0
```

Interface index 6 on the host matches veth1234567, and interface index 5 in the container matches eth0. They are a pair.

**Default bridge subnet:** Typically `172.17.0.0/16`.

## Exercise 2: Build a Container Network from Scratch

### Complete command sequence

```bash
# 1. Create namespaces
sudo ip netns add red
sudo ip netns add blue

# 2. Verify
sudo ip netns list
```

**Expected output:**
```
blue
red
```

```bash
# 3. Create bridge
sudo ip link add br-study type bridge
sudo ip link set br-study up
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.254/24 dev br-study

# 4. Wire up red namespace
sudo ip link add veth-r type veth peer name veth-r-br
sudo ip link set veth-r netns red
sudo ip link set veth-r-br master br-study
sudo ip link set veth-r-br up

# 5. Wire up blue namespace
sudo ip link add veth-b type veth peer name veth-b-br
sudo ip link set veth-b netns blue
sudo ip link set veth-b-br master br-study
sudo ip link set veth-b-br up

# 6. Configure IPs
sudo ip netns exec red ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev veth-r
sudo ip netns exec red ip link set veth-r up
sudo ip netns exec red ip link set lo up

sudo ip netns exec blue ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev veth-b
sudo ip netns exec blue ip link set veth-b up
sudo ip netns exec blue ip link set lo up
```

```bash
# 7. Test connectivity
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 3 10.0.0.2
```

**Expected output:**
```
PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.040 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms

--- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2003ms
```

```bash
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 10.0.0.254
```

**Expected output:**
```
PING 10.0.0.254 (10.0.0.254) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.254: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.030 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.254: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.028 ms
```

### Answers to questions

**What happens if you skip bringing up loopback?**

Most things still work, but some applications that bind to localhost or use loopback for internal communication will fail. It's good practice to always bring it up.

**What does `ip link show master br-study` show?**

```
3: veth-r-br: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    master br-study state UP
4: veth-b-br: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...
    master br-study state UP
```

The two host-side veth interfaces attached to the bridge -- exactly like `ip link show master docker0` shows Docker's veth pairs.

**How is this different from Docker?**

It's the same primitives. Docker automates:
- Namespace creation (one per container)
- Bridge creation (`docker0`)
- veth pair creation and attachment
- IP assignment (via IPAM)
- Route configuration
- iptables rules for NAT

We did all of these steps manually.

## Exercise 3: Enable Internet Access (NAT)

### Complete command sequence

```bash
# 1. Find outbound interface
ip route show default
```

**Expected output (varies by system):**
```
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
```

The interface is `eth0` (use whatever your system shows).

```bash
# 2. Add default routes
sudo ip netns exec red ip route add default via 10.0.0.254
sudo ip netns exec blue ip route add default via 10.0.0.254

# 3. Enable IP forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

**Expected output:**
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

```bash
# 4. Add masquerade rule (replace eth0 with your interface)
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

```bash
# 5. Test internet access
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

**Expected output:**
```
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=10.2 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=9.8 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=9.9 ms
```

```bash
# 6. Compare with Docker's rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v
```

**Expected output (relevant lines):**
```
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    3   252 MASQUERADE  all  --  any    eth0    10.0.0.0/24          anywhere
    0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  any    !docker0  172.17.0.0/16        anywhere
```

Docker's rule looks almost identical to ours -- masquerade traffic from its subnet going out any interface except docker0.

### Answers to questions

**What does the masquerade rule do?**

It rewrites the source IP address of outbound packets from 10.0.0.x to the host's IP on the outbound interface. When the reply comes back, the kernel automatically translates the destination IP back to the original namespace IP. This is Source NAT (SNAT) -- the same thing your home router does.

**Why do we need IP forwarding?**

Without `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`, the Linux kernel drops any packet that arrives on one interface but is destined for another. It only processes packets addressed to its own IPs. IP forwarding tells the kernel to act as a router and forward packets between interfaces.

**Docker's masquerade rule:**

Docker creates a rule like:
```
MASQUERADE  all  --  anywhere  anywhere  source: 172.17.0.0/16  ! out: docker0
```

This masquerades traffic from containers (172.17.0.0/16) going out any interface except docker0 itself. Traffic between containers stays on the bridge and doesn't need NAT.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Network namespaces** are what isolate container networking -- each container gets its own
2. **veth pairs** are virtual cables connecting namespaces to bridges
3. **Linux bridges** are virtual switches that connect multiple veth pairs
4. **NAT/masquerade** rewrites source IPs so namespace traffic can reach the internet
5. Docker automates all of this -- understanding the primitives helps you debug and build beyond Docker
